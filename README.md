 Task 5: Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

 Objective
Capture live network packets and analyze basic protocols using Wireshark.

 Tools Used
- Wireshark (free packet analyzer)

 Protocols Captured
1. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)  
   - Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.  
   - Observed ARP replies mapping IPs like 10.0.2.2 to MAC addresses.

2. DNS (Domain Name System)  
   - Converts domain names like google.com to IP addresses.  
   - Captured standard DNS queries and responses, including A and AAAA records.

3. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)  
   - Used for network diagnostics (e.g., ping).  
   - Observed Echo (ping) requests and replies between host and external IP.

 Deliverables
- Packet Capture: task_capture.pcap
- Report File: wireshark_protocol_report.txt

 Outcome
Hands-on understanding of network protocols and their packet structures using Wireshark.
